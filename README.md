# liriApp

This app was made to either: search a song, search for a bands next concert, or search for a movie.
There are three commands. These three commands should be run in the bash terminal in the root directory of this file.
The three commands are: "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", and "movie-this"(without quotation marks). One of these commands must be entered and followed by whatever you are searching for.
Examples: 
    "node liri.js spotify-this-song the illusionist",
    "node liri.js movie-this deadpool",
    "node liri.js concert-this system of a down"
